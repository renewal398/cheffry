# Database Migrations

To apply the database migrations, you need to run the SQL scripts in this directory against your Supabase database. You can do this by copying the contents of each file and running it in the Supabase SQL editor.

**Important:** Run the scripts in the correct order, starting with `001_create_tables.sql`.
